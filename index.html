             Whilst reading <em>Jane Eyre</em>, I noticed a connection between Jane Eyre & Mr. Rochester's complex relationship and underlying themes in the artist Lana Del Rey's songs. With both portraying romance as having their "ups" and "downs", I want to illuminate the overall theme that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love through this website. I believe this medium works best because it is interactive yet informative on a topic that I thoroughly enjoy. In addition, it puts my Computer Science skills to the test!

                  In 2011 an aspiring singer-songwriter named Lizzie Grant ditched her name and her tarty look and staged a marketing relaunch that allowed her to rise to the heights of stardom. The singer, born in New York City and raised in Lake Placid, had begun her musical career singing in bars. After various failed attempts to break into the popular music market she signed a contract with Stranger records in June 2011. Her debut single was called “Video Games,” and it was the home-made video of this song that went viral on YouTube and brought her overnight success. She, now Lana Del Rey, was immediately signed by Polydor Records and Interscope, home to Madonna and Lady Gaga. Her album Born to Die was released in January 2012 and topped the charts in eleven countries including France, the UK, and Australia, along the way winning the 2012 Brit awards for Best Breakthrough Act in the UK (Vigier 2).

                  Lana Del Rey subjectively goes in depth to discover the foundation of the culture she lives within. In her world, which comprises a never-ending yearning for oneness with a beloved, a pantheon of enticing cultural icons arises, magnified in her perspective, trustworthy and enchanting objects of her desire. Lana seems to have such a total, non-moralistic, and in many ways uncompromising focus on desire that it becomes a valuable source for understanding how desire changes and develops in relationships. Thus, her songs and her world view become poignant contemporary expressions of desire, and they help us to understand the way desire is experienced in our contemporary Western world (Grande 195-196).
