          In "Ride," also from <em>Born to Die</em>, Lana is almost always going through a war in her mind, which is why she just keeps riding despite “…[seeing] stars in [her] eyes.” This consistent inner battle clearly wears her down over time, as she states, “I’m tired of feeling like I’m...crazy.” However, to “…keep [herself] sane,” she just keeps driving. This inner conflict exemplifies the fact that "...so often in Lana’s songs (and in real life), the feeling of love sustains despite outrageous behavior," (Grande 209). However, conversely, Jane simply will not deal with the misdoings of her beloved. Instead of continuing to feel crazy, Jane conserves her sanity by refusing Rochester and leaving Thornfield.<p>Lana Del Rey’s songs, "Off to the Races" and “Ride,” both from her first album, Born to Die, illustrate her initial relationships with older men as a “master and slave” dynamic, which can similarly be compared to Jane and Rochester’s power dynamic when they first meet; Rochester is an older and wealthier man that inevitably has power over the young and vulnerable Jane. However, these songs also illustrate the individuality between Lana and Jane; Lana continues to stay with the “Million Dollar Man,” as she puts it, whilst Jane refuses to ignore the misdoings of her beloved. This introduces the overall theme that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love, as Rochester’s inevitable realization that Jane will not remain by his side unless he reevaluates his own virtues—especially his stances on God and marriage—is established by her refusal in his first proposal.</p>

            This quote takes place in chapter 27, page 483, of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Jane, despite almost being persuaded by Rochester because of her inner conflict, maintains her ability to love herself regardless of how others treat her. In essence, she values her relationship with God more than degrading herself to becoming Rochester’s mistress, an action that is greatly admirable for a woman in her position. <p>As mentioned in Arnold Shapiro’s journal article, “In Defense of Jane Eyre,” critics, including the late academic journal writer Richard Chase, argue that Jane’s choice to refuse Rochester’s first proposal illustrates Jane’s cowardice in the fact that she is “…asserting moral superiority over Rochester,” despite “…[complaining] of her own isolation…” during the “…earlier weeks at Thornfield,” (Shapiro 681-682). However, Jane’s actions can be seen as commendable rather than cowardly. As posed in the same academic article, “…the attack on Jane for leaving Rochester,” in reality, “…pays no attention to the terrible torment Jane undergoes during this period,” (Shapiro 683). <p>Despite Jane having the opportunity to gain his wealth through their union, which could be seen as the “smart” choice to make during this time period, as many loveless marriages were enacted solely for class and wealth, she chooses to preserve her dignity. This choice is not Jane being contradictive towards her own values, but it illustrates the evolution of her morality; her own virtues change as the novel progresses, as does her relationship with Rochester. Thus, the overall theme that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love progresses furthermore, as not only could it be applied to Rochester, but Jane. As her character changes, so does Rochester. Inevitably, this leads them to one another, but not without God to guide both.</p></p>
