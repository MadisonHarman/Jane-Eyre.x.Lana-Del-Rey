           In "Ride," Lana is almost always going through a war in her mind, which is why she just keeps riding despite “…[seeing] stars in [her] eyes.” This consistent inner battle clearly wears her down over time, as she states, “I’m tired of feeling like I’m...crazy.” However, to “…keep [herself] sane,” she just keeps driving. To answer the question in relation to the “Master and Slave” dynamics in many of Lana’s songs, we learn that Jane values her relationship with God over the tolerance of the misdoings of others (Grande 208). Instead of choosing to feel crazy, Jane chooses to stay sane by refusing Rochester and leaving Thornfield.

            This quote takes place in chapter 27, page 483, of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. During this point in the novel, Rochester has been trying to convince Jane to stay with him, even though he is still legally married to Bertha Mason. However, Jane, despite almost being persuaded by Rochester, maintains her ability to love herself regardless of how others treat her and, inevitably, her self-worth. In essence, she values her relationship with God more than degrading herself to becoming Rochester’s mistress. As mentioned in Arnold Shapiro’s journal article, “In Defense of Jane Eyre,” critics, including the late academic journal writer Richard Chase, argue that this choice illustrates Jane’s cowardice in the fact that she is “…asserting moral superiority over Rochester,” despite “…[complaining] of her own isolation…” during the “…earlier weeks at Thornfield,” (Shapiro 681-682). However, conversely, Jane’s actions can be seen as admirable. As posed in the same academic article, “…the attack on Jane for leaving Rochester,” in reality, “…pays no attention to the terrible torment Jane undergoes during this period,” (Shapiro 683). As mentioned beforehand, Rochester has superiority over Jane when it comes to class and wealth. Despite Jane having the opportunity to gain his wealth through their union, which could be seen as the “smart” choice to make in this situation, she chooses to preserve her dignity. This choice is not Jane being contradictive towards her own values, but it illustrates the evolution of her morality; her own virtues change as the novel progresses, as does her relationship with Rochester.
