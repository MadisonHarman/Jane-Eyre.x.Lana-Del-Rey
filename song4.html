            <hr>
            <p class="text">
           In "Dark Paradise," Lana's memories of her beloved are incredibly fond. However, the fact that she describes these memories as a “Dark Paradise” suggests that Lana knows her memory of him is corrupted. However, she is so desperate to have her love back that she even sees him every time she closes her eyes. This, essentially, makes her never forget her memory of him. Given the fact that Lana’s religion is especially rooted in a quest for a beloved, this is expected. Despite all the bad, she only sees the good. In relation to Jane, she can only see the bad in Rochester, which leads to her leaving him. However, when asking God for guidance, she physically hears Rochester call for her, illuminating a sign that he has changed for the better. <p>In "The Grants," a song from Lana Del Rey’s Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd album, and "Dark Paradise," from Born to Die, Lana’s desire for God becomes prominent as she wishes to become her loved one’s Heaven. In fact, Lana’s religion, “…despite its Gnostic and idealistic tendencies,” seems to be rooted on “…both sexual satisfaction and unity with the beloved,” (Grande 199-200). Furthermore, her love is so intense that she cannot bear the possibility of losing her beloved. The same can be similarly said about Jane and Rochester. Although Jane goes through a spiritual journey for independence, God leads her to her beloved in the end, signaling a shift both Jane and Rochester’s virtues, which further progresses the overall theme that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love.</p>

            This quote takes place in chapter 35, page 640, of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Jane is tormented by Rochester's eerie screams and seeks him, despite not even knowing whether he has changed. This can be compared to “Dark Paradise,” as Lana is tormented by the thoughts of her past love, both the good and the bad, and is desperate in finding him again. This stark change in Jane’s opinion towards Rochester signals the true goal of her journey: to be reunited with the one she desires the most. <p>Again, critics, including Chase, accuse Charlotte Brontë herself of “…duplicity…” and “…cowardice…” because of Jane’s calling to God, as she cannot “…be true to her own call for love and passion made earlier in the book,” as Jane also mentioned that “…her spirit is speaking to Rochester’s,” despite that feeling changing quickly after realizing Rochester’s marriage with Bertha Mason (Shapiro 682). However, critics fail to notice what has happened to Jane up until this point. Shapiro puts it plainly, “…her struggles with St. John,” and “…her affirmation of her own individuality…in the name of God,” have influenced her decision up until this moment (Shapiro 683). Due to these circumstances, Brontë accurately depicts what one would do in Jane’s situation: adapt their beliefs based on what their current circumstances are. It is not cowardly to revert or evolve one’s virtues if it accurately displays one’s beliefs, especially if it leads to the character development of both Jane and Rochester.</p>
