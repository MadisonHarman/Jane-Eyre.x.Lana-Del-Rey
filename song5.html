            Lana Del Rey’s “Young and Beautiful” illustrates a woman’s possessive and undying love for a beloved. On the contrast, this song also portrays the woman’s uncertainty towards the relationship by questioning whether her love will still love him when she’s no longer young and beautiful. As Grande notes, “Violence, war, and love seem to be entangled in Lana’s world, ending up in some sort of existential masochism,” (Grande 215-216). This proves to be true when analyzing Lana’s older albums with her newer ones. Earlier on, Lana seems to be trapped in dangerous relationships for the sake of love, causing her to have a war in her mind. However, later, this love becomes genuine as Lana’s “Desire for God” allows for her to seek more in a beloved. This can be similarly applied to Jane and Rochester’s relationship, as their “ups” and “downs” still led them to each other. With Rochester particularly being an individual who was greatly against God at the beginning of the novel, the literal violence he endures allows for him to reform his beliefs and become reborn as a new man.

             This quote takes place in chapter 37, page 679, of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. Rochester asks Jane countlessly if she is finite in her choice to marry him, which directly mirrors the quote from “Young and Beautiful”. Despite his looks or age, Jane repeatedly says yes, finally steadfast in her choice to marry her true love. As mentioned beforehand, many individuals criticize both Jane and Brontë’s “cowardice” because of their tendencies to change their thoughts on both independence and love. However, as Shapiro mentions, these criticisms “…show either a lack of understanding of what Jane Eyre is all about,” or, “…a lack of sympathy with the themes of the book,” (Shapiro 683). The overall theme that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love illustrates this notion. Chase particularly lacks sympathy towards Jane as he is blinded by the fact that Jane seems contradictory in her choices concerning her relationship with Rochester but does not realize that Rochester needed to change to have a flourishing relationship with Jane. This is exemplified by the chronological presentation of their relationship in this project. Not everyone is perfect, even fictional characters, and Brontë accurately depicts this notion.
