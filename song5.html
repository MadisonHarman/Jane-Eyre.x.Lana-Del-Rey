            <hr>

           <p>“Young and Beautiful,” a single created for the 2013 film <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, illustrates a woman’s possessive and undying love for a beloved. On the contrast, this song also portrays the woman’s uncertainty towards the relationship by questioning whether her beloved will still love her when she’s no longer young and beautiful. This exemplifies the notion that “Violence, war, and love seem to be entangled in Lana’s world, ending up in some sort of existential masochism,” (Grande 215-216). This proves to be true when analyzing Lana’s older albums with her newer ones or, in this case, from <em>Born to Die</em> to <em>Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd</em>. Earlier on, Lana seems to be trapped in dangerous relationships for the sake of love, causing her to have a war in her mind. However, later, this love becomes genuine as Lana’s desire for God allows for her to seek more in a beloved: one who values her thoughts and shares a connection with Heaven and, ultimately, God.</p><p>Although Jane’s world is not an “existential masochism,” as she refuses to ignore Rochester’s bad traits, this can be similarly applied to Jane and Rochester’s relationship, as their “ups” and “downs” still led them to each other. With Rochester particularly being an individual who was greatly against God and dismissive of Jane’s feelings concerning Bertha Mason at the beginning of the novel, the literal violence he endures from the house fire allows for him to reform his beliefs and become reborn as a new man. Furthermore, with Jane's own virtues pertaining to God and her relationship with Rochester changing throughout the novel, the unity of the two furthermore illustrate the theme of the novel: the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love. </p>

             This quote takes place in chapter 37, page 679, of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. This interaction directly mirrors the theme of “Young and Beautiful”. Despite his looks or age, Jane repeatedly says yes, finally steadfast in her choice to marry her true love. Thus, Jane and Rochester’s journey ends with both achieving their beloved, despite the many obstacles they had to endure to reach one another.<p>As mentioned beforehand, many individuals criticize both Jane and Brontë’s “cowardice” because of their tendencies to change their thoughts on both independence and love. However, as Shapiro mentions, these criticisms “…show either a lack of understanding of what Jane Eyre is all about,” or, “…a lack of sympathy with the themes of the book,” (Shapiro 683). <p>The overall theme that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love illustrates this notion. Chase particularly lacks sympathy towards Jane as he is blinded by the fact that she seems contradictory in her choices concerning her relationship with Rochester but does not realize that Rochester also needed to change to have a flourishing relationship with Jane. This is exemplified by the chronological presentation of their relationship in this project. Not everyone is perfect, even fictional characters, and Brontë accurately illustrates this notion through the progression of Jane Eyre. This depiction becomes especially prominent when highlighting the similarities between Jane and Rochester’s relationship and Lana Del Rey’s views on romance in her songs, as analyzed in this project.</p></p>
