# HNRS 2030 Un-Essay
## Creative Process
**•	How does your project connect to the text/theme you've chosen, and what elements of that text/theme does your project represent/explore/develop?**<br>
&ensp;Whilst reading Charlotte Brontë’s novel, Jane Eyre, I noticed a prominent connection between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester's complex relationship and underlying themes in the singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey's songs. With both portraying romance as having their "ups" and "downs,” I want to explore one overarching theme in Jane Eyre that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love through not only chronologically describing Jane and Rochester’s relationship but comparing each instance with a song from Lana Del Rey. When noting the context of each song, we can generate conclusions as to how romantic relationships not only influenced Lana, but Jane and Rochester as well, which is important when illustrating how romance in the Western world impacts different individuals. 

**•	What decisions did you make in creating the project, and why? (e.g., why did you decide on this specific genre, form, and/or medium? Why this text/theme? Why this relationship between your project and the source material?)**<br>
&ensp;I believe a website works best when conveying my thoughts because it is interactive yet informative on a topic that is greatly interesting to me. In addition, I thoroughly enjoy challenging myself with projects pertaining to Computer Science—my major! 

**•	What's original about your project, and what's inspired by historical context or other literary representations?**<br>
&ensp;My project is original in the fact that there are seemingly no academic articles on this specific topic, thus my interpretation when it comes to Jane and Rochester’s relationship when compared to Lana’s is inspired by both historical context and literary representations. 

**•	What meanings and directions are suggested by your process and the final product?**<br>
&ensp;In essence, the goal of this project is to illustrate that change is essential when growing as a person. 

**•	What have you learned, and how does the project showcase that learning?**<br>
&ensp;Nobody is perfect, and that is especially true for both fictional and real people, which is something that I have learned when comparing Lana and Jane’s choices in men and how that impacted their future relationships.
