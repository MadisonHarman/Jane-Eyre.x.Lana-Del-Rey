# HNRS 2030 Un-Essay
## Creative Process
Whilst reading Jane Eyre, I noticed a connection between Jane Eyre & Mr. Rochester's complex relationship and underlying themes in the artist Lana Del Rey's songs. With both portraying romance as having their "ups" and "downs", I want to illuminate the overall theme that the ability to overcome oneâ€™s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love through this website. I believe this medium works best because it is interactive yet informative on a topic that I thoroughly enjoy. In addition, it puts my Computer Science skills to the test!
