## Creative Process
Whilst reading Charlotte Brontë’s novel, Jane Eyre, I noticed a prominent connection between Jane Eyre & Mr. Rochester's complex relationship and underlying themes in the artist Lana Del Rey's songs. With both portraying romance as having their "ups" and "downs", I want to illuminate the overall theme that the ability to overcome one’s own virtues is a true sentiment of unwavering love through not only chronologically describing Jane and Rochester’s relationship but comparing each instance with a song from Lana Del Rey. When noting the context of each song, we can generate conclusions as to how romantic relationships not only influenced Jane and Rochester, but Lana as well. I believe a website works best when conveying my thoughts because it is interactive yet informative on a topic that is greatly interesting to me. In addition, I thoroughly enjoy challenging myself with projects pertaining Computer Science—my major! In essence, the goal of this project is to learn that anyone can change. Nobody is perfect, and that is especially true for both fictional and real people. Not only is Brontë just in her literary choices, but so is Jane.
