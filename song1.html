           In “Off to the Races,” Lana expresses her love for a wealthy, older, and dangerous "gangster" boyfriend. The "Million Dollar Man" does not judge her because she is less fortunate than him. In fact, it's one of the things he likes about her; due to her vulnerable position, he is ultimately the one with more power over her. This notion directly mirrors Jane and Rochester’s earlier interactions; Rochester, an older, wealthier man, professes his love for “plain Jane,” the younger, poorer girl. The power dynamic between the two is clear; however, it is how both Jane and Rochester interpret this dynamic that determines whether Rochester is an individual with adverse intentions or not.

           This quote takes place in chapter 23, page 388, of <em>Jane Eyre</em>. At this point in the novel, there have been several instances where Rochester's wealth has impeded potential relationships. Thus, Rochester does have concerns about whether Jane's feelings for him are genuine or if they are influenced by his wealth and status. However, after Jane disproves this, he echoes her words by stating that even though she is "...poor and obscure," or "...small and plain," he loves her (Brontë 388). In this case, I do not believe that Rochester’s goal is to take advantage of Jane because of his power over her. In fact, it seems as if he really loves Jane because she is different from the other women he has encountered. This is illustrated by Charlotte Brontë’s definition of “sympathy,” a word repeated several times during important moments in Jane Eyre, as mentioned in Lara Freeburg Kees’s academic article, “’Sympathy’ in Jane Eyre.” Brontë’s utilization of the word “sympathy” exemplifies Jane’s uniqueness in Rochester’s eyes by suggesting that because she “…is so different from these people,” that “…she lacks sympathy with them,” (Kees 875). This notion foreshadows Jane’s choice when it comes to Rochester’s proposal. Although she has some sympathy for Rochester, as he is not only in love with her but sees her as an intellectual equal, she lacks sympathy for men who already have wives. Furthermore, in "Ride," Lana is almost always going through a war in her mind, which is why she just keeps riding despite “…[seeing] stars in [her] eyes.” This consistent inner battle clearly wears her down over time, as she states, “I’m tired of feeling like I’m...crazy.” However, to “…keep [herself] sane,” she just keeps driving. This inner conflict exemplifies the fact that "...so often in Lana’s songs (and in real life), the feeling of love sustains despite outrageous behavior," (Grande 209). However, conversely, Jane simply will not deal with the misdoings of her beloved. Instead of continuing to feel crazy, Jane conserves her sanity by refusing Rochester and leaving Thornfield. As Rochester begs for Jane to stay with him, despite her finding out about his marriage with Bertha Mason, Jane declares, “’I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.’,” (Brontë 483). Jane, despite almost being persuaded by Rochester because of her inner conflict, maintains her ability to love herself regardless of how others treat her. In essence, she values her relationship with God more than degrading herself to becoming Rochester’s mistress, an action that is greatly admirable for a woman in her position.
